we removed the original petrol engine and replaced it with an electric drivetrain.

## Components

- motor
- inverter
- batteries
- contactors
- wiring
- fuses

## testing

We did some pressure testing on all the components to chekc they would survive at 15psi.

## Battery box

All the batteries, and fuses, main HV contactors, and charging contactors were installed in the rear oil box.
