## About Renewable Bermagui

We are a community-led volunteer organisation based in Bermagui on the Far South Coast of New South Wales, formed in early 2024. We are working to bring events, education, and support our community in transitioning to renewable and sustainable technologies.

We are a local chapter of the [Cobargo and District Energy Transition group (CaDET)](https://renewablecobargo.com){:target="_blank"}

## Our goals

We are a passionate group of volunteers working to:
* Improve access to renewable energy technology in our community
* Help locals lower their energy bill costs
* Increase understanding and use of new technologies for energy resilience and emissions reduction
