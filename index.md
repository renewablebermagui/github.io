## Renewable Bermagui

We are a community-led volunteer organisation based in Bermagui on the South Coast of New South Wales, formed in early 2024. We are working to bring events, education, and support our community in transitioning to renewable and sustainable technologies.

We are a local chapter of the [Cobargo and District Energy Transition group (CaDET)](renewablecobargo.com). 

## Acknowledgement of Country

The Renewable Bermagui team acknowledges the Djiringanj people of the Yuin Nation, the traditional custodians of the land on which this project is situated. We acknowledge that the Djiringanj people have been caring for this country for tens of thousands of years and respect their connections to land, sea and community. We pay our respect to their Elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.
