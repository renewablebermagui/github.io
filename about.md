# Underwater crossing of Darwin harbour

## What

We built and drove a custom eletric landcruiser across the bottom of Darwin Harbour.

## Why

Why not?

But also, to re-attempt a famous attempt from 40 years ago.

## How

We ripped out the old engine and drivetrain and replaced it with an electric one.
All the components needed to be protected from salt water, and also able to survive the pressure at 30m depth underwater.
